CSS selectors:-

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

1.Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2.Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3.Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4.Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5.Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Simple selectors:-

---name selector:- based on element name.

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

---id selector:-

id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

An id name cannot start with a number!

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

--class selector:-

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
